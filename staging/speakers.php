                <p>Cassidy Curtis has worked in computer animation for three decades, in many corners of the field. As a math major (and art minor) from Brown University, he got his start developing image processing and particle systems, and animating TV commercials at R/Greenberg, Xaos, and PDI. He was a researcher and instructor in UW’s GRAIL lab, exploring non-photorealistic rendering (Computer Generated Watercolor and Loose and Sketchy Animation) and teaching an early iteration of the Capstone Animation class. At DreamWorks Animation he rigged characters for Shrek, and then animated them on films from Madagascar to How to Train Your Dragon (on which he co-supervised the main character, Toothless.) In 2015, he jumped into real-time graphics and immersive storytelling, joining Google Spotlight Stories to develop the non-photorealistic look of Patrick Osborne’s Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning short Pearl, and has continued on to work on Jorge Gutierrez’ Emmy-nominated Son of Jaguar and John Kahrs’ Age of Sail, which recently premiered at the 2018 Venice Film Festival.</p>

            <p>Shahram Izadi is CTO and co-founder of perceptiveIO a new bay area research and development lab specializing in real-time computer vision and machine learning techniques for mixed reality and interaction. Previously he was a partner researcher and research manager at Microsoft Research (Redmond) for 11 years where he led the interactive 3D technologies (I3D) group. This was an extremely multi-discipline group, which straddles many boundaries including human-computer interaction, augmented reality, applied computer vision and graphics, electronics, signal processing, and optics.</p>
            <p>His research focuses on building new technologies and systems that blur the boundaries between real and virtual interaction. This typically involves building new types of depth cameras, sensors or displays; creating practical algorithms and techniques for these types of novel technologies; as well as designing new user experiences that are enabled through this technical research.</p>
